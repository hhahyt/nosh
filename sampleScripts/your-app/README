To if you would like to build your own application
against Nosh, the files in this directory may come
in handy.
The recommended structure for a build is

./
 do-configure.sh
 build/
 source/
   CMakeLists.txt
   myfile1.cpp
   myfile2.cpp
   myfile2.hpp
   [...]

The files do-configure.sh and CMakeLists.txt can be taken
from here and adapted for your project.
Calling do-configure.sh from ./build/ should then generate
the necessary Makefiles in ./build/ which can be used
to build your executable:

$ cd build
$ ../do-configure.sh
$ make

If build failures occur, increasing the verbosity of `make'
may help track down the error:

$ make VERBOSE=1

For more guidance and information, any old CMake tutorial will do
(e.g., http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake_tutorial.html).
