MESHES
======

This folder contains a number of example meshes that can be used for computation
with Nosh.
The .geo files are geometric data, that can be used by the free and open-source
mesh generator Gmsh to generate a mesh.

To do so, you can either

(a) invoke Gmsh on the command line

    $ gmsh -2 circle2d.geo -o circle2d.vtk
    $ gmsh -3 -optimize swiss-cheese3d.geo -o swiss-cheese3e.vtk

(b) invoke Gmsh's user interface with

    $ gmsh swiss-cheese3d.geo

    Then choose "Mesh" and "3D". A mesh is generated.
    You can optionally create a finer mesh ("Refine by splitting") or
    optimize the mesh ("Optimize", "Optimize (Netgen)"). Refer to the Gmsh
    documentation for more information.
    Eventually, "Save As..." VTK file. It does not matter if the binary or
    the ASCII format are chosen.
