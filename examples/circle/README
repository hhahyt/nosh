============

This example highlights the solution of the extreme-type-II Ginzburg-Landau
equations for a three-dimensional domain given by circle.geo: A cube
with edge length 10 that has a number of ball-shaped cavities.

Instructions for Nosh
---------------------

1. Create a VTK mesh file from the geometry.
   You can either do that automatically on the command line (a),
   or interactively using Gmsh's user interface (b).
   
   (a) Type

       $ gmsh -2 -optimize circle.geo -o circle.vtk

       on the command line.

   (b) Open the circle.geo with Gmsh,

       $ gmsh circle.geo

       Then choose "Mesh" and "2D". A mesh is generated.
       You can optionally create a finer mesh ("Refine by splitting").
       Refer to the Gmsh documentation for more information.
       Eventually, "Save As..." VTK file. It does not matter if the binary or
       the ASCII format are chosen.

2. Add values for psi and the magnetic vector potential.
   Use tools/nosh-state-equipper to convert the VTK file into Exodus format
   while adding values for the order parameter psi, the potential V, and the
   magnetic vector potential A.

   $ nosh-state-equipper circle.vtk circle.e

   If you are interested in potentials other than what is implemented in
   nosh-state-equipper, you may edit the file to your liking.

   The file circle.e can be inspected with a number of tools. One of them
   is the free and open-source visualizer ParaView, another is Trilinos' own
   command-line program 'io_info'.

3. Run the parameter continuation.
   You can either run it serial mode 

   $ nosh-cont --xml-input-file=./conf.xml

   or in parallel

   $ mpiexec -n N nosh-cont --xml-input-file=./conf.xml

   where N is the number of processors you want to use.

   The file conf.xml contains a plethora of parameters around the numerical
   parameter continuation and can be edited at will.
