EXAMPLES
========

This example highlights the solution of the extreme-type-II Ginzburg-Landau
equations for a three-dimensional domain given by swiss-cheese.geo: A cube
with edge length 10 that has a number of ball-shaped cavities.

Instructions for Nosh
---------------------

1. Get a mesh in VTK or Exodus format.

   You can use any mesh generator you prefer or download meshes from the
   internet.
   The folder meshes/ contains instructions on how to create some simple meshes
   by yourself.

2. Add values for psi, the potential V, and the magnetic vector potential to
   the mesh, and store the result as Exodus (.e) file.

   Again, you can use any tool you like to perform this task.
   The folder state-equippers/ contains some files that will do just that,
   namely enrich your input mesh with the respective states.
   Example:

   $ ./state-equippers/plain-gl mymesh.vtk mymesh.e

   If you would like to adapt the states: Editing the files should be easy
   enough.

   The output file mymesh.e can be inspected with a number of tools. One of
   them is the free and open-source visualizer ParaView, another is Trilinos'
   own command-line program 'io_info'.

3. Run the parameter continuation.

   Now simply add the mesh file to conf.xml
   You can either run it serial mode 

   $ nosh-cont --xml-input-file=conf.xml

   or in parallel

   $ mpiexec -n N nosh-cont --xml-input-file=conf.xml

   where N is the number of processors you want to use.

   The file conf.xml contains a plethora of parameters around the numerical
   parameter continuation and can be edited to your liking.
