SWISS CHEESE
============

This example highlights the solution of the extreme-type-II Ginzburg-Landau
equations for a three-dimensional domain given by swiss-cheese.geo: A cube
with edge length 10 that has a number of ball-shaped cavities.

Instructions for Nosh
---------------------

1. Create a VTK mesh file from the geometry.
   You can either do that automatically on the command line (a),
   or interactively using Gmsh's user interface (b).
   
   (a) Type

       $ gmsh -3 -optimize swiss-cheese.geo -o swiss-cheese.vtk

       on the command line.

   (b) Open the swiss-cheese.geo with Gmsh,

       $ gmsh swiss-cheese.geo

       Then choose "Mesh" and "3D". A mesh is generated.
       You can optionally create a finer mesh ("Refine by splitting") or
       optimize the mesh ("Optimize", "Optimize (Netgen)"). Refer to the Gmsh
       documentation for more information.
       Eventually, "Save As..." VTK file. It does not matter if the binary or
       the ASCII format are chosen.

2. Add values for psi and the magnetic vector potential.
   Use tools/equip_mesh_with_state to convert the VTK file into Exodus format
   while adding values for the order parameter psi and the magnetic vector
   potential A.

   $ tools/equip_mesh_with_state swiss-cheese.vtk swiss-cheese.e

   By default, equip_mesh_with_state adds a vector potential that
   corresponds to the field B=(0,0,1). It contains however other interesting
   potentials and can be edited at will.
   The file swiss-cheese.e can be inspected with a number of tools. One of them
   is the free and open-source visualizer ParaView, another is Trilinos' own
   command-line program 'io_info'.

3. Run the parameter continuation.
   You can either run it serial mode 

   $ cont --xml-input-file=conf.xml

   or in parallel

   $ mpiexec -n N cont --xml-input-file=conf.xml

   where N is the number of processors you want to use.

   The file conf.xml contains a plethora of parameters around the numerical
   parameter continuation and can be edited to your liking.
