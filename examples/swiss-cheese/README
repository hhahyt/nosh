SWISS CHEESE
============

This example highlights the solution of the extreme-type-II Ginzburg-Landau
equations for a three-dimensional domain given by swiss-cheese.geo: A cube
with edge length 10 that has a number of ball-shaped cavities

Instructions for Nosh
---------------------

1. Create a VTK mesh file from the geometry.
   To this end, open the swiss-cheese.geo with Gmsh,
   
   $ gmsh swiss-cheese.geo

   Then choose "Mesh" and "3D". A mesh is generated.
   You can optionally create a finer mesh ("Refine by splitting") or optimize
   the mesh ("Optimize", "Optimize (Netgen)"). Refer to the Gmsh documentation
   for more information.
   Eventually, "Save As..." VTK file. It does not matter if the binary or the
   ASCII format are chosen.

2. Add values for psi and the magnetic vector potential.
   Use tools/equip_mesh_with_state to convert the VTK file into Exodus format
   while adding values for the order parameter psi and the magnetic vector
   potential A.

   $ tools/equip_mesh_with_state swiss-cheese.vtk swiss-cheese.e

   By default, equip_mesh_with_state adds a vector potential that
   corresponds to the field B=(0,0,1). It contains however other interesting
   potentials and can be edited at will.
   The file swiss-cheese.e can be inspected with, e.g., the free and
   open-source visualizer ParaView.

3. (Optional.) Split the file up for running on multiple processes.

   $ tools/loadbal swiss-cheese.e -p 4 2

   The parameter "-p" determines the process mesh, so for this setup, 4x2=8
   files for parallel processing will be generated.

4. Run the parameter continuation.

   $ cont --xml-input-file=./conf.xml

   The file conf.xml contains a plethora of parameters around the numerical
   parameter continuation and can be edited to your liking.
